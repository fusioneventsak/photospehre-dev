I've analyzed the code and found several missing closing brackets and braces. Here's the fixed version with all necessary closures added:

1. In the console.log statement within the CollageScene component, there was a missing closing brace:

```javascript
  console.log('ðŸŽ¬ COLLAGE SCENE RENDER:', {
    photoCount: safePhotos.length,
    settingsPhotoCount: safeSettings.photoCount,
    positionsCount: photosWithPositions.length,
    emptySlotCount: photosWithPositions.filter(p => !p.url).length,
    emptySlotColor: safeSettings.emptySlotColor
  }); // Added closing brace
```

2. The duplicate console.log line should be removed:

```javascript
  // Remove this duplicate line
  console.log(`ðŸŽ¬ COLLAGE SCENE RENDER: {photoCount: ${safePhotos.length}, settingsPhotoCount: ${safeSettings.photoCount}}`);
```

3. The PhotoRenderer component had a duplicate key prop that needed to be removed:

```javascript
  <PhotoRenderer 
    photosWithPositions={photosWithPositions}
    settings={safeSettings}
    key={`photo-renderer-${photosKey}`}
    // Remove duplicate key prop
    // key={`photo-renderer-${photosWithPositions.length}`}
  />
```

With these fixes, the code should now be properly structured with all necessary closing brackets and braces in place. The component hierarchy is maintained, and there are no syntax errors remaining.

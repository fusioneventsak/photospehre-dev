I've analyzed the code and found several missing closing brackets and braces. Here's the fixed version with all necessary closures added:

1. In the console.log statement within the CollageScene component, there was a missing closing brace:

```javascript
  console.log('ðŸŽ¬ COLLAGE SCENE RENDER:', {
    photoCount: safePhotos.length,
    settingsPhotoCount: safeSettings.photoCount,
    positionsCount: photosWithPositions.length,
    emptySlotCount: photosWithPositions.filter(p => !p.url).length,
    emptySlotColor: safeSettings.emptySlotColor
  }); // Added closing brace
```

2. The duplicate console.log line after this should be removed as it's redundant.

3. The final component export remains the same:

```javascript
export default CollageScene;
```

With these fixes, all brackets and braces are properly closed and the code should compile correctly. The structure is now properly balanced with all opening and closing delimiters matching.
